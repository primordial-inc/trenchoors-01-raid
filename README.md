# PumpFun Game Project

A multiplayer boss battle game where players fight against a dragon boss with various mechanics.

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd packages/server
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### 2. Control the Game (Admin CLI)
In a new terminal:
```bash
cd packages/server
yarn admin
```

Or use the helper script:
```bash
./start-admin.sh
```

### 3. Test with Players (Player CLI)
In separate terminals (simulate multiple players):
```bash
cd packages/server
yarn player
# Then: join Player1

# In another terminal:
yarn player  
# Then: join Player2
```

Or use the helper script:
```bash
./start-player.sh
```

### 4. Start the Client
```bash
cd packages/client
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Development Tools

### Admin CLI
Control the game server:
- **Start/Stop** the game
- **Monitor** players and boss status
- **Configure** game settings
- **View** active mechanics

See [packages/server/ADMIN_CLI.md](packages/server/ADMIN_CLI.md) for detailed usage.

### Player CLI
Simulate players for testing:
- **Join/Leave** games
- **Move** around the battlefield
- **Attack** the boss
- **Test** heroism mechanics
- **Multiple instances** for multiplayer testing

See [packages/server/PLAYER_CLI.md](packages/server/PLAYER_CLI.md) for detailed usage.

## Game Flow

1. Server starts in `WAITING` status
2. Admin starts the game â†’ Boss spawns
3. Players join and fight the boss
4. Boss uses mechanics based on health phases
5. Game ends when boss dies or all players die

## Boss Phases

- **Phase 1** (100-60% HP): Basic mechanics
- **Phase 2** (60-30% HP): More complex mechanics  
- **Phase 3** (30-0% HP): Multiple simultaneous mechanics

## Architecture

- **Server**: Game engine, boss mechanics, player management
- **Client**: Web-based game interface
- **Shared**: Common types and events
- **Core**: Shared utilities
